If you receive a notification when you log into the app, the app will ask you to share your location information with your phone to automatically provide weather information for your current address.

If you do not want to share your location information with your phone, you can still use the application to manually find weather information about the desired location with the search engine inside the application.

Note: The location information you share is used by the app only to collect weather data.
